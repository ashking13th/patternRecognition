# CS669 Pattern Recognition

## Assignment 1 - Bayes Classifier

There are three data sets: 
  1.  data_set1: Linear data 
  2.  data_set2: Non-Linear Data 
  3.  data_set3: Real world data
  
Each folder contains:
  Three training data sets:
  1.  class1.txt
  2.  class2.txt
  3.  class3.txt
  
 and three test data sets:
  1.  classt1.txt
  2.  classt2.txt
  3.  classt3.txt
  
  Each of the data set folder contains a python script classifier.py
  Run this file to obtain the corresponding graphs:
    python classifier.py
  
  A folder named 'graph' contains all the graphs pre-generated, organised data set wise.
  set 1 contains graphs for data_set1 and so on.
